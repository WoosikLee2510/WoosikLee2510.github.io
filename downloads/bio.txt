My name is Woosik Lee, and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at
University of Delaware. I am interested in the areas of localization, robotics, and computer
applications. Under the direction of Guoquan Huang, I am exploring the area of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS), multisensor-aided
inertial navigation systems (MINS), online calibration, and consistent & efficient estimation.
I received Bachelor and Master in Mechanical Engineering from the Korea University (2015 / 2017).
